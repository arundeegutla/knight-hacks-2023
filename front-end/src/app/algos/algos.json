            "description": "A Sliding Window is a technique used in computer science and data processing to efficiently perform operations on a fixed-size subset of elements within a larger dataset. It involves defining a window of a specified size that \"slides\" or moves over the data, typically in a sequential manner. This technique is often used for tasks like calculating running averages, finding maximum or minimum values in a moving window, and solving problems involving data streams, time series, or arrays. Sliding windows are valuable for optimizing algorithms where you need to process and analyze data in continuous or overlapping segments, helping to reduce time and space complexity.",
